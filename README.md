# Personal Brand Site

This is a personal brand site built using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and TypeScript. The site showcases various projects, provides information about the individual, and allows users to get in touch.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personal-brand-site.git
   cd personal-brand-site
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Vite development server, and you can view the site at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the production-ready files.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

To deploy the site to GitHub Pages, ensure you have set up the GitHub Actions workflow in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file. Push your changes to the main branch, and the site will be automatically deployed.
